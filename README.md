  <h1>gart</h1>
  <h3>A python-like scripted language named after the similarly underwhelming snake.</h3>
  <h5>Equipped with primitives (number, bool, string, null), first class functions and native functions, Gart lacks any of the depth found in a real language, but makes up for it with a cute logo.</h5>
</div>

## Usage

### Sandbox

The easiest way to use Gart is with the sandbox found at https://sandbox.skybounce.io.

More details can be found at https://github.com/Pybounce/sandbox.
